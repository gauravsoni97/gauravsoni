        I have designed and developed a note-taking web application using
        ReactJs, which mimics the exact user interface of popular note-taking
        apps. This app allows users to create, edit and organize notes in a
        visually appealing and user-friendly environment.

    description:<>I have created the Money Management Tool, a web-based application that helps users manage their finances
    based on the 50-30-20 rule of budgeting. Users can edit and delete existing notes, and the application provides
    data storage to keep track of the user's financial history and progress over time. Through the development of this
    application, I have gained expertise in web development, data storage.
